A Smart Contract Language based on design by contract and Event-B.

## Structure of Smart Contracts on Smarty

All Smart Contract written is composed by:

- Entities: They are very similar to the Tables on SQL Data Models and struct Data Structures on C and C++. 
  They have a name and fields with their respectives Types. 
  
- Events: They are analagous to the Functions and Methods on many Programming Languages.
